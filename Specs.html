			<h2>Curses</h2>
        <ul>

        <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <p>Curses is a stat and time managment game that forces difficult decisions from a series of events.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            <p>Players should feel a little stress as they are forced to make difficult decisions and gamble on the lives of their fellow explorers.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Genre:</strong>
            <p>Stat/resource management.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Game play:</strong>
        <p>Curses main interaction is through the decision making of the player (pressing buttons). Given options, the player selects between a variety of outcomes trying to preserve the 2 resources, 1: health 2: paces for his/her explorers. If health (max 3) is reduced to 0, an explorer is killed, if pace (max 3) is reduced to 0 for each additional pace removed, a d6 is rolled and it is determined whether the explorer is killed. Indicated in the top right, the player tries to keep as many explorers alive as possible for 10 turns, until the explorors emerge from the tomb. Each turn presents different options that the player must contend with.</p>
            
        <p>In this prototype, the player faces the choice of 1: Fighting the sentinals. In which all explorers lose 1 health, and 1 pace.
            2: Doubling Back. Adding 1 additional turn to contend with, but allowing all explorers to gain 1 health. 3: Hiding. All explorers lose 2 paces.</p>
        
        <p>In a full implementation, there would be dozens of events that are randomly selected with different choices. Additionally, the buttons would be more obscure, using sprites such as levers, or highlighting a part of the environment rather than having obnoxious blue buttons.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
        <p>The prototype's goal is to simulate one of the many events the game would ask the player to deal with and lays down some of the basic features. Three of the important features were not complete when the prototype was submitted, outlines of a decision, which were meant to be on hover events for the buttons, multiple explorers, and the timer which stopped functioning.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Features:</strong>
        <p></p>Fast paced time and resource managment. Randomly generated event orderings/Replayability.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
        <p>This game is set in the 1940's on an expedition into a long lost tomb. The expedition successfully traverses the seemingly safe and linear tomb. Upon reaching the tomb's antichamber, the explorer's find an ancient artifact worth a fortune. In their haste to recover the artifact they release a curse that take the form of a creeping dark sickly black fog. As the expedition leader, it's your responsibility to get as many explorers out alive as possible, but the task won't be easy. In addition to the cursed fog that is chasing the group, numerous machinations have awoken within the tomb and the layout itself has become contorted and obscured with traps. What first seemed a trivial expedition, has quickly become a struggle to escape with anything at all.</p> 
        </li>

        <li><strong>Story:</strong>
         The gameplay's narrative is tied to the gameplay mechanics, players have health, the resource that simply governs whether they are alive or dead, and pace that is an interaction with the creeping fog as explorers try to keep "paces" in front of the fog. While explorers may fall behind, an RNG roll determines whether they will stumble into the fog and vanish. The aesthetic also adds to the gusto of the game (think Indiana Jones).
        </li>

        <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
        <p>People who enjoy quick games(mobile) with some strategy will enjoy this in addition to people who enjoy board games.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Play time:</strong>
        <p>10-15 mins</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
        <p>Players who can do quick arithmetic and dutifully manage their pace will be more likely to be successful in getting a greater number of explorers out alive.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

            -Drag Camera: <a href=http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/2410-drag-the-camera/>link</a>
        -"Cartoonized" art assets from Bethesda's Skyrim: <a href=http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls2/images/e/e5/Draugr.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131005064542&path-prefix=de>link</a></p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
        <p>This game most resembles the card game Hearthstone. In an "adventure" mode boss battle, they featured some similar mechanics such as health, turns to escape, and a "explorer" theme.</p>
